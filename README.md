# Zoom Cleanup Plugin

This is a simple plugin for chrome that has a single purpose:  Close leftover zoom meeting tabs in Chrome.

## Background
I use Google Suite and GMail a lot and attend an aggrassive quantity of Zoom meetings.

When launching Zoom from a browser, the URL is a zoom.us domain of some form, which then opens their app.

Zoom doesn't clean up after itself when launching its app from a browser.

As a busy professional, during a zoom meeting I'll hop around in tabs to track documents discussed in the call or keep up with email.  By the time I am through a day's worth of zoom meetings, there's a bunch of leftover zoom tabs.

So after enough iterations of finding and closing zoom.us meeting launcher tabs, I hit the flustration wall and wrote this super basic extension to deal with the process.
